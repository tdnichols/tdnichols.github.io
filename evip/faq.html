	<h2>eVIP Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

	<h3><a name="Invoice"></a>Invoice Status</h3>

	<h4>How do I look up the status of an invoice?</h4>
	<p>Log in to iSupplier, and select the Search field drop-down from the top of the Home Page. Select Invoices and enter your invoice number in the Search field. Select Go. You can also research invoices by selecting the Invoices link from the Quick Links section, or by selecting the Account tab at the top right corner of the page or the Account link at the bottom of the Home Page.</p>

	<h4>Who should I contact if my invoice is on hold?</h4>
	<p>If your invoice is on hold, please contact your Contracting Officer, Buyer or IC Vendor Support. The contact information is available in iSupplier by using the “Find My CO/Buyer/IC Vendor Support” search tool.</p>

	<h4>Who should I contact if I have invoice questions?</h4>
	<p>You can use the “Find My CO/Buyer/IC Vendor Support” search tool in iSupplier to find contact information for invoice status-related questions about holds. For any other invoice related questions, contact the eVIP Helpdesk.</p>

	<h3><a name="Registration"></a>Registration</h3>

	<h4>Why do I need to set up a user profile?</h4>
	<p>The creation of a user profile will permit you to be issued a personal, secure password to verify your identity each time you attempt to log in. The delivery of this password to you will confirm your identity and grant you access your personal information; making sure that someone else is not trying to access your account.</p>

	<h4>Why do I need another password to log in?</h4>
	<p>By requesting an additional password, a significantly higher level security can be provided to you and your personal information when you log in. By using a second password delivered to contact information that you provided, a higher level of assurance can be established that you personally are logging in, as opposed to an unauthorized person attempting to gain access your account and information.</p>

	<h4>Why do I need to provide you with my contact information?</h4>
	<p>Personal, secure passwords can be delivered to you in a variety of ways, based on the information you submit. These methods can be a voice call to one of your phone numbers, a text message sent to a cell phone you possess or provided directly to you by your smart phone, if you installed the mobile application.</p>

	<h4>Why are you asking for multiple contacts?</h4>
	<p>It is recommended that you enter several different contacts in your profile. A password will be sent to you each time you attempt to log in so that your identity can be confirmed; so please be sure to enter contacts that you will have access to, when you to typically log in.</p>
	<p>As an example, if you work from home it is recommended to enter your cell phone and your home phone number, either of which you can specify to receive your password. If you typically use your cell phone to receive your password and the cell phone battery is dead, or you lose it; you can request your password to be sent to your home phone (through an automated call) and still be able to log in.</p>

	<h4>Why do I need to create a PIN?</h4>
	<p>If you are using the mobile application, you will need to enter this PIN number to gain access to the application and use it as the delivery mechanism to receive your personal, secure password.</p>

	<h4>Why are you asking for my personal information?</h4>
	<p>Personal information like the last 4 digits of your SSN, your birth month and year and/or your current address is used to definitely verify your identity, so that you can be granted the appropriate and secure access when you log in.</p>
	<p>Verizon employs a variety of techniques and services to verify your identity. One of the tools used to confirm your identity requires the verification of antecedent data or data that is the result of historical transactions and events specific to you. In order to accurately locate your historical data records used in the identity verification processes, the last four digits of your Social Security number and the month and year of your birth are used to ensure we verify you against your historic data records.</p>

	
	  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Please be sure to enter accurate information, as it is requested during the registration process, failure to do so could limit your access or prevent you from logging in.</p>
	

	<h4>How is my identity verified?</h4>
	<p>The registration process ensures the existence of your identity per comprehensive industry standards. Please note that not all the data requested may be necessary to verify your identity. The verification process stops once your identity has been verified. Hence some data for some users may not be checked.</p>
	<p>Regardless, all users registered via Universal Identity Services (UIS) satisfy the highest standards. Specifically, Universal Identity Services is verified by the Federal Identity, Credentialing and Access Management (FICAM) program, as a level 2 &amp; 3 issuer for non-PKI credentials and certified by Kantara, which is a certified FICAM Trust Framework Provider.</p>

	<h4>Why do I need to answer security questions?</h4>
	<p>If you are ever unable to access your account (if for example you only have a cell phone as a contact and you lose it), you will be asked these security questions to confirm your identity before you are permitted to access your account and user profile. Therefore, when you answer the questions, please be sure to answer clearly and in a way that you will remember the specific responses you entered.</p>

	<h4>Is the data I provide secure?</h4>
	<p>Yes. Verizon manages this service and has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of all personal information maintained by UIS, especially your personally identifiable information, such as your government issued identifiers.</p>

	<h4>Why did my social security number and/or date of birth verification fail?</h4>
	<p>The Universal Identity Service utilizes you name, SSN, and month/year of birth information provided during the application process to access your historical data records used to verify your identity. If for some reason UIS is not able to retrieve your records, please check to ensure that your name, Social Security number, and month/year of birth were entered correctly.</p>

	<h4>While registering, I didn’t get the one-time passcode. What do I do?</h4>
	<p>Select another method/contact and try again. You can use either the same method for receiving the code or try a different method, such as email, home, work or cell phone.</p>

	<h4>What should I do if my account is deactivated?</h4>
	<p>If your account is deactivated, please identify the email code at the bottom of the deactivation alert and contact the Helpdesk.</p>

	<h4>Do I need to download any software to use this service?</h4>
	<p>No, for processing of you payment we do not require any additional software. For the Universal Identity Services ID, that will be provided after your payment has been processed, you will have access to downloadable software.</p>

	<h4>Is the eVIP Payment Portal a secure web site?</h4>
	<p>When you enter information online, the information will be scrambled using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. Although we cannot guarantee encryption or the privacy of your data, SSL makes it very difficult for your data to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred. When we receive your data, it is kept encrypted until we’re ready to process it.</p>

	<h4>How will you share my personal information?</h4>
	<p>For the payment portion of this service all financial transaction information occurs through PayPal. The PayPal privacy policy is available <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">here</a>.</p>

	<h3><a name="Payment"></a>Payment</h3>

	<h4>Is there a fee for this service that I will have to pay?</h4>
	<p>Yes. The eVIP Payment Portal will require an annual fee in order to support the cost of the Universal Identity that has been provided to you.</p>

	<h4>If I am unwilling to pay this service fee, can I still use this service?</h4>
	<p>No. The service fee covers the cost of providing a unique ID for processing NIH invoices and is not negotiable.</p>

	<h4>Will I be automatically charged an annual renewal fee?</h4>
	<p>No, you will be sent reminder emails approaching the end of the annual period about renewing your membership.</p>

	<h4>Can I cancel a payment once it has completed?</h4>
	<p>No. If you make a mistake with the payment, you should contact the NIH helpdesk. Please review all requirements of the eVIP service carefully before you accept and submit payment for the service. Once transactions have been submitted, they cannot be canceled or changed.</p>

	<h4>Is my payment processed immediately?</h4>
	<p>Yes. Your credit card is charged immediately. Once the transaction has settled with your credit card and we receive the funds, the payment is sent to the company providing this service for NIH. Please allow seven days for your payment to be received.</p>

	<h4>What do I do if I am having trouble with the payment portal or viewing the pages?</h4>
	<p>Please contact the eVIP helpdesk.</p>

	<h4>Who should I contact if the transaction is declined?</h4>
	<p>You should contact the bank or financial institution that issued the card.</p>

You will be asked security questions as part of these steps and will need to provide the correct answers to the questions.</p>

	<h4>I forgot my username. How do I find or reset it?</h4>

Once you have logged into the profile manager, you can find your username at the top right corner of the eVIP home page.</p>

	<h4>What username and password do I use for iSupplier Login and BizAdmin Login?</h4>
	<p>You use the password for your Verizon Universal Identity Services (UIS) identity.</p>

	<h4>How many times can I try entering my password before it is locked?</h4>
	<p>Passwords can be tried three (3) times before they are locked and need to be reset.</p>

	<h4>How do I reset my password?</h4>
	<p>Enter your email address and verify your identity by successfully answering your security question. Then, enter the email address where you’d like the one time password to be sent. Finally, enter your new password (the system will automatically take you back to the NIH website) where you can then login to iSupplier.</p>
